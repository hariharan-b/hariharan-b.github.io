    <div class="post-content">
      <p>Hopefully you&rsquo;ve read my <strong>About Me</strong> page. I was running an online radio station which used to play songs 24x7 and its hosted from my laptop connected to speakers in living room.</p>

<p>Songs play all the time and I do remote work. Whenever I get an incoming call or I make an outgoing call (to join meeting) I had to find my remote and reduce the speaker volume or mute it. This seems to be a repetative task and many times the remote is lost :)</p>

<p>I wanted to automate this and build a seemless experience of attending a phone call while speakers mute and unmute by itself. I was using a motorola Atrix Android phone at that time and below is what I implemented.</p>

<ul>
<li>Develop an Android app service which listens for call broadcast instance</li>
<li>Whenever a call is placed and broadcast message is received to my app service, call a Web API</li>
<li>Build the WebAPI in PHP which runs in windows laptop (same machine where radio application is running)</li>
<li>when the WebAPI is invoked with Call connected parameter execute OS command to mute System Volume</li>
<li>when the WebAPI is invoked with Call disconnected parameter execute OS command to unmute system volume</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Yes this is my version of IFTTT 10 years back</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Below is the Android Service Code piece which is always listening for the LISTEN_CALL_STATE event from TELEPHONY_SERVICE
and call the toggleMute function which sends the request to the PHP Web API service.</p>

<pre><code class="language-java">@Override
	public void onCreate() {
		Log.d(LOG_TAG, &quot;FOXXPlaybackService onCreate&quot;);
	    telephonyManager = (TelephonyManager) getSystemService(TELEPHONY_SERVICE);
	    // Create a PhoneStateListener to watch for offhook and idle events
	    listener = new PhoneStateListener() {
	      @Override
	      public void onCallStateChanged(int state, String incomingNumber) {
	        switch (state) {
	        case TelephonyManager.CALL_STATE_OFFHOOK:
	        case TelephonyManager.CALL_STATE_RINGING:
	          // Phone going offhook or ringing, pause the player.
	        	toggleMute(true);
	          break;
	        case TelephonyManager.CALL_STATE_IDLE:
	          // Phone idle. Rewind a couple of seconds and start playing.
	        	toggleMute(false);
	          break;
	        }
	      }
	    };
	    
	    // Register the listener with the telephony manager.
	    telephonyManager.listen(listener, PhoneStateListener.LISTEN_CALL_STATE);
	}
</code></pre>

<p>Below is the PHP code which process the POST request sent by mobile and toggle speakers mute status</p>

<pre><code class="language-php">&lt;?

if(isset($_POST['action']))
{
	if($_POST['action'] == 'MUTE')
		$action=1;
	else
		$action=0;
}
else
{
	$action=0;
}

if($action)
	echo &quot;mutting&quot;;
else
	echo &quot;Unmutting&quot;;

exec ('c:\\WINDOWS\\nircmd.exe mutesysvolume ' . $action, $arr);

exec ('c:\\WINDOWS\\nircmd.exe mutesubunitvolume &quot;Speakers&quot; &quot;Speakers&quot; ' . $action, $arr);

?&gt;
